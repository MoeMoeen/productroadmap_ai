	Cognitive Layer: Deliberation (Layer 9)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Presenting generated plans, profiles, and strategies to the user for review and feedback
	- Allowing for human-in-the-loop approval, refinement, or rejection of outputs
	- Updating the plan or profile based on user feedback

	Business Logic Context:
	- Ensures transparency, explainability, and user control
	- Supports iterative improvement and auditability

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "think-before-do" and user review step in the cognitive pipeline
	- May call atomic nodes like present_plan_to_user_node

	Usage:
	- Should be run after reasoning and planning layers
	- Updates state with user feedback and approval status

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to present outputs to user and capture feedback
	- Integrate with atomic user review nodes
