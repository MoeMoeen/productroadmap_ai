	Cognitive Layer: Execution (Layer 10)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Persisting the final roadmap, initiatives, and links into the database
	- Ensuring all outputs are saved and available for downstream consumption

	Business Logic Context:
	- Marks the transition from planning to action
	- Supports traceability and future retrieval of outputs

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "action" step in the cognitive pipeline
	- May call atomic nodes like save_outputs_node

	Usage:
	- Should be run after user review and approval
	- Updates persistent storage with all final outputs

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to persist outputs to DB
	- Integrate with atomic save nodes
