	Cognitive Layer: World Model (Layer 3)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Updating the internal representation of the current organization context (products, KPIs, goals, etc.)
	- Maintaining a structured, up-to-date snapshot of the business state
	- Integrating new information from parsed documents and extracted entities

	Business Logic Context:
	- Synthesizes org-level metadata, structure, and context
	- Enables downstream layers to reason about the business as a whole
	- Supports strategy, planning, and validation steps

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "world model" for the cognitive pipeline
	- May call atomic nodes for extracting and updating org-level facts
	- Ensures the system has a coherent, up-to-date view of the business

	Usage:
	- Should be run after the memory layer
	- Updates the world model representation in persistent storage or in-memory state

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to update world model from state (e.g., parsed documents, extracted entities)
	- Integrate with WorldModel ORM/model when available
