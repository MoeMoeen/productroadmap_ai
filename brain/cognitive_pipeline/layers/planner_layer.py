	Cognitive Layer: Planner (Layer 7)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Generating, updating, and managing actionable plans or roadmaps
	- Using the current GraphState (business profile, goals, entities, etc.) to create a structured plan
	- Calling atomic nodes (e.g., generate_roadmap_node, enhance_initiatives_node) for specific planning sub-tasks
	- Updating the GraphState with the generated plan for downstream layers

	Business Logic Context:
	- Turns high-level strategy and objectives into a concrete, step-by-step plan
	- Supports multiple prioritization frameworks (RICE, WSJF, MoSCoW, etc.)
	- Surfaces roadmap variants for user review and feedback

	Architectural Role:
	- Orchestrates the planning logic in the cognitive pipeline
	- Ensures all plans are aligned with business context and goals
	- May call atomic nodes for roadmap generation and prioritization

	Usage:
	- Should be run after initiative/entity extraction and business understanding
	- Updates state.generated_roadmap with the plan output

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to generate and prioritize roadmaps
	- Integrate with atomic planning/prioritization nodes
