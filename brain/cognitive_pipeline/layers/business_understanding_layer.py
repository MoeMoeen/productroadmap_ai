	Cognitive Layer: Business Understanding (Layer 4)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Extracting high-quality strategic insights from parsed documents
	- Detecting document types (e.g., business plan, strategy deck)
	- Generating a structured, consolidated BusinessProfile object (vision, strategy, product model, KPIs, initiatives, goals, etc.)
	- Presenting the profile to the user for feedback/approval (via downstream layers)

	Business Logic Context:
	- Synthesizes the business model, goals, KPIs, target segments, and core problems/opportunities
	- Enables downstream entity extraction and initiative generation to be context-aware

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "strategic synthesis" step in the cognitive pipeline
	- Bridges raw document parsing and structured entity extraction
	- May call atomic nodes like elicit_strategy_insights_node

	Usage:
	- Should be run after the world model layer
	- Updates state.business_profile with a BusinessProfile object

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to extract and synthesize business insights
	- Integrate with atomic nodes for strategy extraction
