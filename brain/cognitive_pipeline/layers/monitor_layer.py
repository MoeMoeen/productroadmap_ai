	Cognitive Layer: Monitor (Layer 11)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Detecting missing objectives, unlinked initiatives, schema errors, and low-quality alerts
	- Performing quality and coherence checks on all outputs

	Business Logic Context:
	- Ensures outputs meet quality standards and business requirements
	- Supports error detection and alerting

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "quality gate" for the cognitive pipeline
	- May call atomic nodes like quality_gate_node

	Usage:
	- Should be run after execution layer
	- Updates state with quality check results and alerts

	TODO:
	- Implement logic for quality and coherence checks
	- Integrate with atomic quality gate nodes
