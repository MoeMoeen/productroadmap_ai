	Cognitive Layer: Learning (Layer 12)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Capturing user feedback, edits, or rejections to improve future extractions and outputs
	- Updating internal models or heuristics based on feedback

	Business Logic Context:
	- Enables the system to learn and adapt over time
	- Supports continuous improvement and personalization

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "feedback loop" for the cognitive pipeline
	- May call atomic nodes like capture_feedback_loop_node

	Usage:
	- Should be run after monitor/quality gate layer
	- Updates state and/or persistent storage with learning signals

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to capture and process user feedback
	- Integrate with atomic feedback nodes
