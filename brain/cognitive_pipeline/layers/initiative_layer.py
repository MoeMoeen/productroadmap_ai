    Cognitive Layer: Product Initiative (Layer 6)

    This layer is responsible for:
    - Generating product initiatives aligned to extracted business/customer objectives
    - Suggesting new initiatives based on business context and goals
    - Populating the GraphState with proposed initiatives for planning

    Business Logic Context:
    - Bridges the gap between business objectives and actionable plans
    - Ensures all initiatives are relevant and strategically aligned

    Architectural Role:
    - Acts as the "initiative generation" step in the cognitive pipeline
    - May call atomic nodes like generate_product_initiatives_node

    Usage:
    - Should be run after entity_extraction_layer
    - Updates state with proposed initiatives

    TODO:
    - Implement logic to generate initiatives from objectives and context
    - Integrate with atomic initiative generation nodes
