	Cognitive Layer: Reasoning (Layer 8)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Validating the strategic coherence and alignment of the generated plan
	- Ensuring each initiative aligns with business context, strategy, and objectives
	- Detecting inconsistencies, missing links, or low-quality outputs

	Business Logic Context:
	- Provides a "sanity check" before surfacing outputs to the user
	- Supports quality assurance and auditability

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "critical thinking" step in the cognitive pipeline
	- May call atomic nodes like validate_alignment_node

	Usage:
	- Should be run after the planner layer
	- Updates state with validation results or flags

	TODO:
	- Implement logic to validate plan alignment and coherence
	- Integrate with atomic validation nodes
