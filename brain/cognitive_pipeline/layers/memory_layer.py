	"""
	Cognitive Layer: Memory (Layer 2)

	This layer is responsible for:
	- Capturing episodic memory (steps, documents, results) for each run
	- Updating semantic memory (facts, entities, insights)
	- Persisting to memory models (e.g., SemanticMemoryEntry, EpisodicMemoryEntry)
	- Optionally, integrating with a vector DB or knowledge store (mocked for now)

	Business Logic Context:
	- Stores normalized documents and extracted entities for long-term reference
	- Enables the system to recall past facts, context, and results across runs
	- Supports downstream reasoning, validation, and learning layers

	Architectural Role:
	- Acts as the "memory bank" for the cognitive pipeline
	- Ensures all key information is persisted and available for future steps
	- May call atomic nodes for granular memory operations

	Usage:
	- Should be run after the perception layer
	- Updates persistent storage with new documents and entities

	TODO:
	- Implement real ORM/model persistence for memory entries
	- Integrate with vector DB or knowledge store as needed
