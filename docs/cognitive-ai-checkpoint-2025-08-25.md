# ðŸ§  Cognitive AI System â€” Checkpoint Report (2025-08-25)

## 1. Where We Are: Current State Overview

### âœ… Architecture & Structure
- **Restructured codebase** to follow a clear separation between cognitive layers (`layers/`), atomic nodes (`nodes/`), and shared schemas/utilities.
- **Centralized LangGraph DAG** in `graph.py` for modular, explainable pipeline wiring.
- **All major cognitive layers scaffolded**: perception, memory, world model, business understanding, entity extraction, initiative generation, planning, reasoning, deliberation, execution, monitoring, and learning.
- **Shared schemas** (`schema.py`) and models (`models/`) are defined for all key data contracts: `GraphState`, `ParsedDocument`, `BusinessProfile`, `PlanForStep`, `ExtractedEntity`, etc.

### âœ… Data Contracts & Utilities
- **GraphState**: Unified state container for pipeline, with all required fields.
- **BusinessProfile**: Rich, structured org profile, now consistently updated from both database and pipeline extraction.
- **PlanForStep**: Deliberation/planning schema for explainable AI steps.
- **Logging and error handling utilities**: Stubs in place, with plans for production-grade upgrades.
- **Relationship schema**: YAML-based, now injected into LLM prompts for robust, auditable relationship extraction.

### âœ… Pipeline Logic
- **Entity extraction**: Combines keyword/regex and LLM-based extraction, with deduplication, enrichment, and relationship inference.
- **World model layer**: Now updates `BusinessProfile` using correct summary models and field mapping.
- **LLM prompts**: Parameterized, with injected world model, prior entities, and relationship schema.
- **Initialization**: Pipeline can now start with the latest org data from the database using `BusinessProfile.from_organization`.

### âœ… Documentation & Planning
- **Architecture and restructuring docs**: Up-to-date, with rationale, folder structure, and best-practice implementation plan.
- **Checklists**: For data contracts, models, utilities, and validation.

## 2. What We Have Done Since Last Checkpoint

- **Restructured the codebase** for clarity and modularity (see `project-restructuring-2025-08-20.md.md`).
- **Standardized all schemas and models**; added/updated docstrings and type hints.
- **Implemented world model layer** to map extracted entities to the correct `BusinessProfile` fields and summary models.
- **Added relationship schema YAML** and prompt injection for LLM-based extraction.
- **Enabled pipeline initialization from org database** using `BusinessProfile.from_organization`.
- **Enhanced entity extraction logic**:
    - Deduplication, enrichment, and robust relationship inference (both heuristic and LLM-driven).
    - Logging and observability hooks in all major nodes/layers.
- **Documented best-practice pipeline build order** and provided a detailed checklist for Step 1 (data contracts/utilities).
- **Audited all core data contracts and utilities** for completeness and correctness.

## 3. Next Logical Steps

### A. Complete Data Contracts & Utilities
- [ ] Standardize on a single `ParsedDocument` schema/model and use it everywhere.
- [ ] Upgrade logging utility (`log_node_io`) to production-grade.
- [ ] Add error handling and LLM/vector DB helpers as needed.
- [ ] Add usage examples and improve docstrings for all schemas/models.
- [ ] Run static type checking (e.g., mypy) and add schema/model unit tests.

### B. Implement/Refine Layers and Nodes
- [ ] Fill in all stubbed logic in cognitive layers and atomic nodes.
- [ ] Implement the business understanding layer and user review nodes.
- [ ] Integrate the deliberation layer before major cognitive steps (entity extraction, planning, reasoning, etc.).
- [ ] Add human-in-the-loop review/feedback nodes for strategic plans and profiles.

### C. Testing & Observability
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all layers/nodes.
- [ ] Add fixtures for sample documents and expected outputs.
- [ ] Add structured logging, error handling, and metrics/tracing throughout the pipeline.

### D. Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Expand architecture docs and add usage examples for all data contracts.
- [ ] Maintain a migration/CHANGELOG file for major changes.
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams as the implementation progresses.

## 4. Summary

- The system is now modular, explainable, and ready for rapid, iterative development.
- All core data contracts and pipeline scaffolds are in place.
- Next steps focus on standardization, filling in business logic, testing, and observability.
- The project is well-positioned for both robust productization and future research/experimentation.
